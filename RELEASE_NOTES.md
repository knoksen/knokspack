# Release Notes - 3.0.0

Upgrade notes and migration steps for v3.0.0.

Key actions:

- This release upgrades dev tooling (Vite, Tailwind, TypeScript, Jest) and adds CI.
- If you run builds locally, install Node.js 20+ in WSL or your environment.
- The WordPress plugin expects a Vite manifest; ensure built assets land in `dist` as before.
- See `UPGRADE_TO_V3.md` for a step-by-step migration guide.
