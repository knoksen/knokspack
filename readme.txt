== Description ==

**WP Site Suite is the only plugin you need to manage and supercharge your WordPress site.**

Tired of juggling dozens of plugins for security, performance, marketing, and design? WP Site Suite combines all the essential features into one powerful, lightweight, and easy-to-use package. From a robust security shield and real-time backups to AI-powered content creation and detailed analytics, our suite provides a complete, self-hosted solution for creators, businesses, and agencies.

Take control of your website with a unified dashboard and a comprehensive set of tools designed to work perfectly together.

**Key Feature Modules Include:**

*   **Backup & Restore:** One-click site and database backups with automated scheduling, local storage (pluggable for cloud), and simple restoration from any backup point.
*   **Performance Boost:** Optimize site speed with a global CDN integration, image lazy loading, JS deferral, and CSS/JS minification.
*   **Advanced Search:** A powerful, self-hosted AJAX search engine with real-time indexing, faceted filtering, and language-aware results.
*   **AI Content Helper:** A Gutenberg block for AI-powered content writing, translation, and image generation (via OpenAI).
*   **Social Media Automation:** Connect your social accounts to auto-publish new posts and re-share existing content with a full scheduling UI.
*   **Growth Tools:** Boost engagement with a newsletter system (with double opt-in), advanced SEO meta controls, an XML sitemap, and related posts.
*   **On-Site Analytics:** A privacy-focused, lightweight stats module to track views, visitors, referrers, and top content without external services.
*   **CRM:** A built-in Customer Relationship Manager to track contacts, companies, quotes, and invoices, with WooCommerce integration.
*   **And much more!** All features are modular and managed from a central dashboard.

== Installation ==

**Minimum Requirements**

*   WordPress 5.8 or greater
*   PHP version 7.4 or greater
*   MySQL version 5.7 or greater OR MariaDB version 10.2 or greater

**Automatic installation**

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WP Site Suite, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "WP Site Suite" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

**Manual installation**

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need API keys for all the features? =

Some modules require API keys to connect to third-party services. These include:
*   **AI:** OpenAI API key for content and image generation.
*   **Social:** API keys for Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. for auto-posting.
*   **Spam Protection:** An Akismet API key is recommended for the best spam filtering.

All other core features, like security scanning, backups, performance boosts, and local search, work out-of-the-box without any external keys.

= Will this plugin slow down my site? =

No! WP Site Suite is built with performance in mind. Modules are loaded efficiently, and features like our stats tracker use a lightweight, asynchronous script to avoid impacting your site's speed. The performance boost features are specifically designed to make your site faster.

= Is this a self-hosted solution? =

Yes. Unlike other all-in-one plugins, WP Site Suite is designed to be fully self-hosted. Your data (backups, stats, CRM contacts) stays on your server, giving you complete control and privacy.
